## Home Assistant Configuration

[Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/) is a super cool [open source home automation platform](https://home-assistant.io/). This repository contains the configuration I run at my house.

## Interacting w/ the house

* Walk around. Carry your phone with you. Observe sensors try to do the right thing.
* Use [Siri](./doc/siri.md) when they don't.
