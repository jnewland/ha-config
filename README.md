## Home Assistant Configuration

[Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/) is a super cool [open source home automation platform](https://home-assistant.io/). This repository contains the configuration I run at my house.

## Interacting w/ the house

* [Alexa](./alexa/README.md)'s smart home functionality is decent.
* [Siri](./doc/siri.md) has been configured for limited functionality when you're not near an Echo.
