## Siri

Siri integration is limited, and is designed for situations when an Echo isn't nearby.

### Speakers

> Turn on the **outdoor** / **upstairs** / **downstairs** speakers.

> Turn on the **atrium** / **patio** speakers.

### Scenes

> Turn on **away**.

### Switches

> Turn on the **atrium fountain**.

#### Developing

1. Add `homebridge_visible: true` to devices you'd like to control via Siri.
2. Restart the homebridge deployment after deploying ^^.
3. Get mad about not automating ^^.
