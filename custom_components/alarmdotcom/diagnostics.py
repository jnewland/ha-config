"""
Diagnostics support for Alarm.com.

Exposes everything the integration currently knows: config entry data
(redacted), connection/websocket health, and a raw JSON:API dump of every
resource across every controller (locks, sensors, thermostats, cameras,
partitions, etc.) - the same raw data the per-sensor "Debug" button logs
one device at a time, but comprehensive and available as a single
downloadable file via Settings -> Devices & Services -> Alarm.com ->
Download diagnostics (or per-device, from that device's own page).

Sensitive values (credentials, session tokens, camera stream tokens) are
redacted before this data is ever assembled into the returned dict -
diagnostics downloads are meant to be safe to attach to a GitHub issue.

    Return a raw JSON:API dump of every resource across every controller.

    Keyed by controller class name (LockController, SensorController, etc.)
    so the output is grouped by device type without needing HA's own entity
    layer at all - this is the underlying Alarm.com data as the library
    receives it, before any of it gets mapped onto HA entities.

    Note: this deliberately does NOT include real camera data, even though
    a CameraController exists in this list - cameras are fetched through a
    completely separate mechanism (AlarmCameraSession, see
    _camera_diagnostics below), not through fetch_full_state() like every
    other resource type, so CameraController's own .items is always empty in
    practice. Confirmed against a real diagnostics download from a live
    account with real cameras, sensors, locks, and lights: every other
    controller had real counts, only CameraController and a few
    camera-adjacent controllers (GateController, WaterSensorController,
    WaterValveController, ImageSensorImageController) came back with zero
    items - a real, pre-existing architectural gap, not a bug introduced
